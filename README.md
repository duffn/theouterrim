### Contributing with stats

#### YAML

All of the stats are kept in the `data` directory in one file each per stat type. In order to add a new entry, follow the format in the YAML file.

Audits of current stats are welcome and appreciated. Even a single character counts!

If you have any questions about stats, don't hesitate to open an issue.

#### Spreadsheet

You can also currently add new stats in a central [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NLgyvj_xCfOGdDGqqfX1xtOvjmucXA0J_8LVq5d4Tm4/edit#gid=0). See the instructions there.

### Just contact me
