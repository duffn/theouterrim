<h5>Who made this?</h5>
<p>The Outer Rim code is maintained by a few folks and the content is
  contributed and curated by even more!</p>
<p>Immense credit goes to the original Viluppo
  Star Wars FFG Index. That site was shut down in February 2020 and The Outer Rim was born from its ashes.</p>

<h5>What is "free and open-source"?
</h5>
<p>Free is well, free. You're never going to get charged to use this
  site. Ever.</p>
<p>As for "open-source," it means
  that all the code that powers this website is<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/duffn/theouterrim">available
    online</a> <!-- -->and is open to contributions from others.
</p>

<h5>Can I help with some code?</h5>
<p>Absolutely! Check out the<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/duffn/theouterrim">repository on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h5>Why are some records missing data in some
  columns?</h5>
<p>We are constantly adding new data and
  auditing existing data. If you see a column that is empty for a particular record, it probably just hasn't been
  updated yet! If it's been that way for awhile, then something may indeed be wrong.<!-- --> <a
    href="mailto:feedback@theouterrim.co">Reach out</a> <!-- -->and
  let us know. Check back often for new and updated data.</p>

<h5>I found a bug in the data!</h5>
<p>Thanks for catching that! There is a link
  on each and every item detail page that you can use to send us an email and let us know about the issue.</p>

<h5>I found a bug in the code!</h5>
<p>Oops, sorry about that! If you could report
  it on the<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/duffn/theouterrim/issues">issues page</a> <!-- -->and we'll take a
  look.</p>

<h5>I have an idea for a new feature!</h5>
<p>Awesome! If you could let us know on
  the<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/duffn/theouterrim/issues">issues page</a>, we'll take a look.</p>

<h5>I'm not finding my item in the search. What gives?</h5>
<p>
  There are a few reasons why you might not be finding what you're looking for.
<ul>
  <li>First, I may not have that item in the database yet. Getting all of the data in is the highest priority task for
    the site right now.</li>
  <li>Or, since the search only returns a maximum of 50 items, if you're looking for too generic of an item, you may
    want to try refining your search.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h5 id="old-site">This site looks different. Where's the old site?</h5>
<p>
  I re-wrote the site in June 2024. I hadn't updated the old version in quite some time, largely because
  I didn't like the language and framework that I wrote it in. Re-writing it is an attempt to spark my interest
  and excitement in the project again.
  You can still access the old site<!-- --> <a href="https://old.theouterrim.co">here</a>.
  Note that the old site is no longer being updated and will be shut down at some point in the future.
