          The Outer Rim is a free and open-source fan-made site for Fantasy
          Flight Games' Star Wars role-playing game. Here you can find stats on
          weapons, vehicles, characters, and more!

            Immense credit goes to the original Viluppo Star Wars FFG Index.
            That site was shut down in February 2020 and The Outer Rim was born

            Free is well, free. You're never going to get charged to use this

            As for "open-source," it means that all the code that powers this

            Why are some records missing data in some columns?
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            We are constantly adding new data and auditing existing data. If you
            see a column that is empty for a particular record, it probably just
            hasn't been updated yet! If it's been that way for awhile, then
            something may indeed be wrong.{" "}

            and let us know. Check back often for new and updated data.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>
            Why can't I sort by some columns?
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            In an effort to get more content in quickly, we disabled sorting on
            some columns. I'll spare you the tecnical details as to why this is,
            but rest assured that we will be turning sorting back on soon! Note
            that, in the meantime, you can still filter by these columns, so if
            you're looking for a particular value, use the filter in the
            upper-right hand corner of a table.
